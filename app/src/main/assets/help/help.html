    <h3>Keyboard Input Modes&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h3>
    Keyboard input is done using one of the two possible input modes:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Auto (this is the recommended&nbsp;mode)</li>
        <li>Complete line</li>
    </ol>
    <!--2brm Dedicated input field with a dedicated "Send" button-->
    Selecting the input mode is done in the <i>Settings/Terminal</i>
    screen with the "Keyboard input mode" selector.<br>
    When using the app with the "<i>Auto</i>" input mode, simply tap the
    main screen to bring up the keyboard.
    In this mode every character is sent to the serial device as
    it is typed on the keyboard just like on a "real" terminal.<br>
    When using the app with "<i>Complete line</i>" mode, a text
    input field appears near the screen bottom. text that is typed
    in this input field is sent to the serial device when the "Send"
    button is pressed. It is also possible to set the application
    to send the text when the Enter key is pressed.
    The main advantage of using the
    app with dedicated input field is that you can edit the text locally,
    and send it to the serial device only when you are sure it is correct.
    It also enables use of input methods that are not generating single key
    events such as swipe keyboards.<br>
    Obviously using the "<i>Complete line</i>" mode is substantially
    different than using a "real" terminal. Also, when using
    the "<i>Complete line</i>" mode, it is not possible to send
    control-characters.

<section id="control_panel">
    <h3>Control Keys Panel&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h3>
    It is possible to send
    control characters (e.g. Ctrl-C) and arrows escape-sequences.<br>
    This is done from the "Control Panel". To access the Control
    Panel, click the "<i>Controls</i>" button <img src="btn_controls.png" alt="Controls button" style="width:24px;height:24px;vertical-align:middle;">
    in the top bar.
    In order to hide the Control
    Panel, simply press the "<i>Controls</i>" button again.<br>

    <section id="sending_control_chars">
        <h4>Sending Control Characters&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h4>
        When using the keyboard in "<i>Auto</i>" mode it is possible
        to send control-characters (e.g. Ctrl-C).
        Sending a control character is done by pressing the "Ctrl" button
        in the <i>Control Keys Panel</i> and
        then the specific character. For example, to send Ctrl-D, press the
        Ctrl button and then&nbsp;'D' or 'd' on the keyboard. When the Ctrl button
        is pressed, it is marked with a red "LED" indicator.
        After the control character is sent, this "LED" is turned off. If
        you want to send another control character, repeat this process.
    </section>
    <section id="arrow_keys">
        <h4>Arrow Keys&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h4>
        The <i>Control Keys Panel</i> has four arrow-keys. Pressing
        each one of these keys sends the appropriate escape-sequence.
    </section>

<section id="dtr_and_cts">
    <h3>Controlling DTR and CTS&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h3>
    To set or reset the state of the serial port's DTR and CTS lines,
    Select the appropriate action from the drop-down menu. To open
    the drop-down menu press the three-dots icon on the right of
    the top-bar.
</section>

<section id="status_line">
    <h3>Status Line&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h3>
    At
    the bottom of the display, below the main screen, the app displays a
    status line. On the left side there's an "LED" indicating whether a USB
    device is currently connected (green LED) or not (gray LED) or
    some communication error occurred (red LED).<br>
    The rest of the status line displays the current status or error
    messages.<br>
</section>

<section id="text_hex">
    <h3>Text/Hex display&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h3>
    Data can be displayed in two ways:
    <ul>
        <li>Text - This is the "normal" way. In this mode the app behaves
        like a typical terminal</li>
        <li>Hex - In this mode data is displayed as a hex-dump.</li>
    </ul>
    It is possible to switch between these modes by clicking on the
    <img src="btn_text_hex.png" alt="Text hex button" style="width:24px;height:24px;vertical-align:middle;">
    button. When switching mode, you don't loose the buffered data, so you
    can freely switch back and forth between these two modes.
</section>

<section id="logging">
    <h3>Session Logging&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h3>
    <i>Session Logging</i> can be enabled in the <i>Settings/General</i> screen.<br>
    If Session Logging is enabled, the app creates a log file every
    time it is started (or when Session Logging is enabled after it
    was disabled).<br>
    The log file contains a simple dump of every byte that was received
    without any formatting. I.e. it may contain non-printable characters.<br>
    When Session Logging is enabled, you can choose to also log outgoing data.
    Outgoing data can be simply logged together with the incoming data, or
    it can be marked with a special mark. If you choose to mark outgoing data,
    it is wrapped with "OUT{" and "}". E.g. the log file may contain
    <span class="nobr code">OUT{some output text}</span>.<br>
    Log files can be accessed by clicking "Log Files" in the navigation drawer.<br>
    If your device has an application that can display plain text (it most
    probably has), you can view a log file by selecting it and clicking the
    <i>View-File</i> button in the top bar.<br>
    In order to send log files elsewhere, select the files you want to send,
    and use the <i>Share</i> button to send them (e.g. you can email them using
    your standard email app).<br>
    The log files are sorted by creation time. The sorting order can be
    reversed by clicking the <img src="btn_sorting_order.png" alt="Sorting order button" style="width:12px;height:24px;vertical-align:middle;">
    button in the top bar.<br>
    The list of log files can be refreshed by swiping it down when at its top.
    <section id="email_addresses">
        <h4>Default Sharing Email Addresses&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h4>
        It is possible to set a Default Sharing Email Address(es) in <i>Settings/General</i>.
        This is a list of comma-separated email addresses. When you share log files
        by emailing them, these email addresses are automatically set as the recipient
        address. This can save the need to re-type email addresses if you tend to
        send log files to the same recipients (e.g. if you tend to send log files
        to yourself, put your email address in this field).
    </section>
</section>

<section id="bg">
    <h3>Background Operation&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="small">top</span></a></h3>
    Background Operation can be enabled by selecting "Work also in the background"
    in <i>Settings/Terminal</i>. When this mode is selected, the app will continue
    to communicate with the USB device even if the user switches to another app.
    Any data received during background operation is stored in the app's buffer,
    and will be displayed when the user returns to the app. This data is also
    logged if logging is enabled.<br>
    When the app is working in the background, a small terminal icon appears in
    the device' notification bar. Pulling-down the notifications shade
    provides access to the app's notification section. This looks like this:
    <img src="notification.png" alt="Notification" style="display:block;width:100%;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;">
    Clicking on "OPEN APP" opens the UsbTerminal app. Clicking on "STOP" stops
    the background operation and disconnect from the USB device.
