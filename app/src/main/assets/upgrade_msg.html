<h2 class="center" style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em;">Welcome to v2.0</h2>
UsbTerminal was updated to version 2.0. The last update of
UsbTerminal v1.x was way back in 2016.
Version 2.0 is a complete re-write of the app. It has
a new look, a new (flat) app icon, and many new features.<br>
Some of these new features are:
<ul>
    <li>Support for some VT100 escape-codes</li>
    <li>Display data as text or as hex-dump</li>
    <li>Support of additional device types</li>
    <li>Support of text coloring</li>
    <li>Support of communication in the background even when using
    other apps</li>
</ul>
UsbTerminal is now open-source. Its source code can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/liorhass/UsbTerminal">https://github.com/liorhass/UsbTerminal</a>.
<p>
    For help on how to use this new version of the app, please go to
    the "Help" page (accessible from the navigation-drawer)
</p>
<p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> One issue with this update is that the directory
    where the app stores log-files has changed. Unfortunately due to
    security and privacy enhancements in Android, the app can
    no longer access old log-files that were generated with older versions.<br>
    You should be able to access these files with a file manager app
    such as "Files by Google". Look for a directory named "usbterminal"
    under "Internal storage" or an SD card if you have any, or under
    "/storage/emulated/0/usbterminal".<br>
    I'm sorry for this inconvenience.
